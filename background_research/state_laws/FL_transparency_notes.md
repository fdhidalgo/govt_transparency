  * (2)(a) Automation of public records must not erode the right of access to those records. *As each agency increases its use of and dependence on electronic recordkeeping, each agency must provide reasonable public access to records electronically maintained and must ensure that exempt or confidential records are not disclosed except as otherwise permitted by law*.
  
  * (e) *Providing access to public records by remote electronic means is an additional method of access that agencies should strive to provide to the extent feasible.* If an agency provides access to public records by remote *electronic means, such access should be provided in the most cost-effective and efficient manner available to the agency providing the information.*
  
  * (f) Each agency that maintains a public record in an electronic recordkeeping system shall provide to any person, pursuant to this chapter, a copy of any public record in that system which is not exempted by law from public disclosure. An agency must provide a copy of the record in the medium requested if the agency maintains the record in that medium, and the agency may charge a fee in accordance with this chapter…”
